-----C Assignment - Functions and Header Files-----

In this Assignment we demonstrates the Header and functions files. By this we implement the functions and headers in our program.

It has two Objectives:
1. Number Property Functions.
2. Array Utilities Files.

#In Objective 1 we have these files:
1. mylib.h
2. mylib.c

By these files we make the Number functions we is used to check the following:-
1. Armstrong Number
2. Adams Number
3. Prime Palindrome

#In Objective 2 , we have the following files :-
1. arraylib.h
2. arraylib.c

By these we implement the following functions:
1. Find the max/min of array
2. Find the Average of array
3. Sort an Array
4. Reverse an array
5. Linear search 


#To show the working of these two we create a file called main.c. in main.c we design a menu implementing the both objectives of the assignment.

# Compilation :-

To compile this use the following code given below:

gcc main.c mylib.c arraylib.c -o program.exe
